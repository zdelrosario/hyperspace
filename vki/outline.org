* Introduction
** Thought Experiment
- Thought experiment -- cheap model runs in 1 second
- Tensor product quadrature -> exponential scaling!
** My goals
- Motivate DR -- situate problem in UQ field
- Explain a few concepts
- Point to literature
- Shameless self-promotion

** UQ Tasks
- Quantification ~ computing expectations
- Expensive in high dimensions

* Curse of Dimensionality
- Coined by Bellman -- exhaustive optimization
- Manifests across disciplines -- different attributes

** High-dimensional geometry
- Hypersphere is empty
- Hypersphere equator (!)
- Johnson-Lindenstrauss

* Lifting the Curse
** Approaches
- Faster simulations -- algebraic
- Smarter DOE -- algebraic?
- J-L? -- dimension reduction; exponential
  + J-L not connected to response

** Dimension Reduction
- /Sensitivity analysis/
- /Active subspace/

** Sensitivity Analysis
- Subset reduction
  + Morris screening
  + Sobol' indices
- Subspace reduction
  + PCA-primer
  + Active subspaces

** Subset reduction
- Morris screening -- quick and dirty, interpretation?
- Sobol' indices -- more expensive, variance attribution
  + interpretation: variable importance

** Subspace reduction
- PCA -> identify directions that capture variance
- AS -> identify directions that capture function variability
  + interpretation: dimensionless numbers!
