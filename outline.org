* Aircraft design                                         :cold_open:lecture:
- Lots of people have flown on aircraft (relevant)
- Lots of considerations -- focus on structural sizing; bulkheads
- Data matrix: soft introduction

* Modeling 							    :lecture:
- Building planes is expensive -- build a model instead
- Engineers build models with physics
- Statisticians build models with data (crude distinction!)

* Computer Experiment 						    :lecture:
- Thought experiment -- cheap model runs in 1 second
- Increase number of bulkheads considered, 10 points per bulkhead
- Exponential scaling!

* Curse of Dimensionality 					    :lecture:
- 'Cost increases exponentially with dimension'
- Vague term; manifests differently across fields

* Dimensionality 						    :lecture:
-

* Big Data 							    :lecture:
- Related, but distinct
- Dimensionality == Number of columns in data matrix

* Cursed! Concentrated Staring 					    :lecture:
- Can't visualize more than 3 dimensions
- Can't store more than ~7 items

* Cursed! Integration 						    :lecture:
- Square vs circle hypervolume
- Nearly all points on boundary
- Requires exponential samples for integration

* Cursed! Regression 						    :lecture:
- Number of fitted values grows with dimension
- Makes fitting high-dimensional models difficult

* Approach: Dimension Reduction 				    :lecture:
- Direct solution: /reduce dimensionality/

* Solution? Few Directions 					    :lecture:
- /Principle Component Analysis/
- /Active subspace/

* Concentrated Staring 						       :demo:
